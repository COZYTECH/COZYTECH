Executive Summary
I design and operate backend systems that handle real-world constraints: concurrency, failure, scaling, security, and production reliability.
With over 5 years of hands-on engineering experience, I’ve built and deployed:
-Real-time communication systems

-Payment & reservation backends with strict state control

-Redis-backed session architectures

-Cloud-native APIs running on Linux infrastructure

-Production mobile apps backed by scalable services

-Backend services in JavaScript and Go

## I don’t separate backend from infrastructure — I build systems end-to-end.

## What I Specialize In

Backend System Design Service-layer architecture,
Idempotent APIs & safe retry mechanisms,
Explicit state machines (RESERVED → PAID → CANCELLED),
Concurrency-aware design,
Relational schema modeling (MySQL),
Cache strategies using Redis,
WebSocket-based real-time systems,

## Production Infrastructure
Linux server provisioning & hardening,
Nginx reverse proxy & load balancing,
PM2 process management & clustering,
Environment isolation (dev/staging/prod),
Log-driven debugging & performance analysis,
AWS EC2 deployments.

## Full-Stack Ownership
React Native applications with real-time updates,
Optimistic UI patterns,
API integration & contract design,
Lifecycle-based socket management.

## Systems I’ve Designed & Shipped
Real-Time Communication Platform

WebSocket event contract architecture

Presence tracking & typing indicators

Message synchronization after reconnect

Optimistic UI for performance perception

Robust socket lifecycle handling

Designed for reliability under unstable network conditions.

## Payment & Reservation Backend

Controlled state transitions with strict validation

Expiration logic using timestamps (no cron dependency)

Idempotent transaction handling

Redis session persistence

MySQL relational integrity constraints

Built to prevent double charges and race-condition failures.

## Cloud Deployment Architecture

Provisioned Linux servers from scratch

Configured Nginx as reverse proxy

Managed Node clusters with PM2

Secured infrastructure with firewall & access controls

Implemented structured logging & runtime monitoring

Production-first engineering mindset.
