Executive Summary
I design and operate backend systems that handle real-world constraints: concurrency, failure, scaling, security, and production reliability.
With over 5 years of hands-on engineering experience, I’ve built and deployed:
-Real-time communication systems

-Payment & reservation backends with strict state control

-Redis-backed session architectures

-Cloud-native APIs running on Linux infrastructure

-Production mobile apps backed by scalable services

-Backend services in JavaScript and Go

## I don’t separate backend from infrastructure — I build systems end-to-end.

## What I Specialize In

Backend System Design Service-layer architecture
Idempotent APIs & safe retry mechanisms
Explicit state machines (RESERVED → PAID → CANCELLED)
Concurrency-aware design
Relational schema modeling (MySQL)
Cache strategies using Redis
WebSocket-based real-time systems
Production Infrastructure
Linux server provisioning & hardening
Nginx reverse proxy & load balancing
PM2 process management & clustering
Environment isolation (dev/staging/prod)
Log-driven debugging & performance analysis
AWS EC2 deployments
